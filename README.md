# 😷 Face Mask Detection System using CNN & OpenCV

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person in an image is **wearing a mask** or **not**, using a trained model and OpenCV face detection.

---

## 🎯 Objective:
Classify whether a detected face is wearing a mask or not.

## 🔧 Tech Stack:
- OpenCV (Haar Cascades)
- TensorFlow/Keras (CNN)
- Python
- Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset:
We use a labeled dataset with two folders:
- `with_mask`
- `without_mask`
-🔗 **Link**: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset/data)
---

## ⚙️ Features:
- Face detection with Haar cascades
- CNN model to classify mask presence
- Image-based mask detection
